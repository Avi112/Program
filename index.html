      For bibliophiles, a book is their universe from where they withdraw inspiration, motivation, empathise or become one with the characters
       of the story and experience the rare sort of an euphoria that even materialistic things cannot bring.

       They are are also like time-machine that takes us to meet the legends of the past and their captivating history.
       Maybe that's why, there's no other better mentor than books; no bigger inspiration than books.
       Now, with online books store, buying books have become really easy with multitude of genres present at one place.
